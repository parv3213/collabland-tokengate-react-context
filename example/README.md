# Collab Token Gated Page Demo

This GitHub repository contains a demo page for testing the Collab Token Gated Page API. The demo allows you to create a token-gated page where users need to possess specific tokens to access its content.

2. Navigate to the project's directory:

cd collabland-tokengate-react-context/example

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:

npm install

4. Obtain the necessary API keys:

- Visit [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/) and sign in to create a new project. Make a note of the project name and project ID.
- Visit the [CollabLand API Dev Portal](https://dev-portal.collab.land/signin) and sign in to obtain an API key.

5. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and fill it with the obtained API keys:

## Usage

Once the project is running and you have accessed the demo page, you can interact with the token-gated page. Users will need to possess specific tokens to gain access to the page's content. The page will verify token ownership through the Collab Token Gated Page API.
